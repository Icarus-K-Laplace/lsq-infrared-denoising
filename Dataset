This project evaluates AWLF-Fast on the **Tianjin University open UAV remote-sensing infrared grayscale image dataset**.

## Official Record
- Dataset ID (CSTR): `CSTR:14804.11.sciencedb.space.00579`
- URL: https://cstr.cn/14804.11.sciencedb.space.00579

## Usage & License
- This repository does **not** include or redistribute the dataset.
- Please download the dataset from the official CSTR page and follow its license/terms and citation requirements.

## Modality
- Infrared, grayscale (uint8 assumed in `[0, 255]` after loading)

## Preprocessing (Reproducibility)
To make experiments reproducible, the evaluation pipeline uses:
- Input type: grayscale `uint8` in `[0, 255]`
- No resizing by default (native resolution)
- Synthetic impulse noise for controlled benchmarking:
  - Salt-and-pepper noise density: `{0.2, 0.4, 0.6}`
  - Random seed: `42` (fixed)

## Recommended Reporting
Because AWLF-Fast is non-learning-based (no training required), we recommend reporting:
- Mean ± std of PSNR/SSIM over a fixed subset of images
- Runtime on CPU (including image size and hardware details)
